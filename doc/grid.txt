We want a grid with the following features:

* clean, good looks
* easy to use API
* integrates well with jQuery 
* enables editing
* read-only cells

handsontable
============

* http://handsontable.com/
* is clean, seems easy to use, jQuery-ish, editing, read-only

DataTables
==========

* http://datatables.net/
* finding this a bit bloated, only editable with new plugin

Some others - I dunno, handsontable seems by far the nicest for my purposes.
