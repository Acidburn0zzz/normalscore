normalscore
===========

Converts between scales commonly used by psychologists of values on a
normal distribution.

Uses the following libraries, all included for convenience:

* [jQuery] [1] -- for DOM manipulation
* [Flot] [2] -- for plotting
* [jStat] [3] -- for statistics. Note, I use the Github version, not the 
  one on jstat.org.
* [JavaScript sprintf] [4] -- can't code without a sprintf.
